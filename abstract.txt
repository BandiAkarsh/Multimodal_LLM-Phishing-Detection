Phishing Website Detection Method Based on
Multimodal Large Language Models
Abstract
Phishing websites continue to pose a serious cybersecurity threat by imitating
legitimate online services to deceive users into revealing sensitive information.
Traditional phishing detection approaches, such as blacklist-based filtering and
machine learning models relying on handcrafted features, are increasingly
ineffective against modern phishing attacks that employ obfuscation, dynamic
content, and short-lived domains. To address these limitations, this abstract
paper presents a phishing website detection approach based on multimodal large
language models (LLMs).
The proposed approach utilizes multiple modalities of website information,
including URL characteristics, HTML source code features, visual webpage
content, and security-related metadata such as SSL certificate and domain
information. These heterogeneous features are transformed into structured
textual representations, enabling a large language model to perform multimodal
feature fusion through semantic understanding. By reformulating phishing
website detection as a text classification problem, the model leverages the
reasoning capability of LLMs to identify phishing patterns more effectively.
The expected outcome of this approach is improved phishing detection accuracy
and better generalization to previously unseen phishing websites when
compared to traditional single-modality methods. This abstract paper serves as a
preliminary proposal for a full IEEE-style base paper and subsequent project
implementation.
